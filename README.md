# PermutationPairs

Determine the number of possible permutations given an array 'A' consisting of integers where each integer occurs at most 2-times (Pair) and a[n] - a[n-1] != 0.

# Input Format

The first line contains a single integer denoting the number of queries. 

The  subsequent lines describe each query in the following form:
  The first line contains an integer denoting the number of elements in array .
  The second line contains space-separated integers describing the respective values of 'A'.

2       <- Denotes number of queries

4       <- Denotes number of elements in query.  This is query 1 of 2.

1 1 2 2 < - Denotes space separated integers

2       < - Denotes number of elements in query.  This is query 2 of 2.

1 2     < - Denotes space separated integers
